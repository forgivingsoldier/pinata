Follow the process below:

<workers_analysis>
Carefully review the execution report to understand the outcome of the previous sequence execution. We have provided with a screenshot taken at the end of each worker's execution. What went wrong?
</workers_analysis>

<last_screenshot_analysis>
Look at the screenshot associated with the last worker of the sequence. Analyze its content to help you decide on what to do next.
</last_screenshot_analysis>

<recovery>
Since the previous sequence failed:
   a. Determine if it's possible to recover from the failure without deviating significantly from the test intent.
   b. If recovery is possible, explain how it is still aligned with the test case's overall logic and intent.
   c. If recovery is not possible or would require significant deviation from the test intent, decide to stop the test case execution and assign a failed verdict.
</recovery>

<decision>
State your decision: "try new plan" or "assign verdict"
</decision>

If you decided to continue with a new sequence (partial or full) to continue progressing towards the completion of the test step, follow the same format and guidelines as in the initial planning phase for creating Act and Assert statements.

Remember, your goal is to make the best decision for the test execution based on the available information and to provide clear, actionable guidance for the next steps or a well-justified conclusion to the test case.
Please do not diverge from the test step. Accomplishing it should be straightforward. If it not possible, probably best to assign a failed verdict a call it a day.
Labels are ephemeral, do not use them to guide your workers if you noticed they used the wrong label. Instead, give them precise spatial information.
