Your task now is to analyze the execution report and determine the appropriate next action. Follow these steps:
<workers_analysis>
Carefully review the execution report to understand the outcome of the previous sequence execution. We have provided with a screenshot taken at the end of each worker's execution
</worker_analysis>
<last_screenshot_analysis>
Look at the screenshot associated with the last worker of the sequence. Analyze its content to help you plan for the new sequence.
</last_screenshot_analysis>

Then generate another sequence (partial or full) to continue progressing towards the completion of the test step.

Follow the same format and guidelines as in the initial planning phase for creating Act and Assert statements.
Remember, your goal is to make the best decision for the test execution based on the available information and to provide clear, actionable guidance for the next steps or a well-justified conclusion to the test case.
